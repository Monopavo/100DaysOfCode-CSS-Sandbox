## Transforms ##

Use "@keyframes" followed by the animation's alias in order to define the animation.
Encapsulate the frames of the animation within curly braces by using the "transform" property. 

EXAMPLE:

@keyframes myAnimationName {
    from { transform: translateX(0); }
    to { transform:translateX(100px); }

//OR// 

@keyframes myAnimationName {
    0% { transform: translateX(0); }
    100% { transform: translateX(100px); } 

0% indicates the beginning of the animation, and 100% the end. Any amount of keyframes can be interpolated between them.

Add the animation to the rule with the "animation" shorthand, which consists of...

    animation-name: (Self-explanatory.)
    animation-duration: (The amount of time to complete one animation cycle (in s or ms).)
    animation-timing-function: (Determines the style of easing between keyframes.)
    animation-iteration-count: (How many times the animation is repeated.)

All values within the animation are relative to the starting position of the element; translating 200 pixels to the right, and then translating 200 pixels to the left, will NOT return the element to "0"; it will simply translate 200 pixels to the left of 0.





## Transform Values ##

transform: rotate(?deg) // Uses degrees. Rotates the element. Positive is clockwise, negative is anticlockwise.

transform: scale(1) // Uses a point-scale, with 1 being the element's base size. Proportionally increases the height and width of the element. 

transform: translate(x, y) // Uses coordinates. Moves ("translates") the element in the specified axis; X-positive is to move right, Y-positive is to move down.  
transform: translate3d(x, y, z) // Same, but with added z-axis; Z-positive is pushing the element away from the viewer. Requires its parent element to have the "perspective" property.
transform: translateX() // Strictly moves the element along the X-axis.
transform: translateY() // Strictly moves the element along the Y-axis.
transform: translateZ() // Strictly moves the element along the Z-axis.

transform: skew(x, y) // Uses degrees. Distorts ("skews") the element along the X and Y axes.
transform: skewX() // Strictly skews the element along the Y-axis.
transform: skewY() // Strictly skews the element along the Y-axis.





## Timing / Easing Function Values ##

alternate // "Loop". Runs through all 0% => 100% keyframes, then back to 0% in one cycle. 
alternate-reverse // "Ping-pong". Runs through all 100% => 0%, then alternates between starting at 0% and 100% for each cycle.

ease // The default; Starts slow, briefly fast in middle, then slows down.
ease-in // Starts slow, ends fast.
ease-out // Starts fast, ends slow.
ease-in-out // Starts slow, consistently fast in middle, ends slow.

linear // A constant, smooth transition through all frames.

steps(x) // x = total number of keyframes - 1 (basically, excluding 0%). Effectively "pauses" the animation at each frame.





## Cubic Bézier ##

cubic-bezier(c1, c2, c3, c4) // Allows for completely custom timings. Each argument represents a "control point" on a Bézier curve (Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)...

c1 = Start of timing function, using X-coordinates.
c2 = Start of easing function, using Y-coordinates.
c3 = End of timing function, using X-coordinates.
c4 = End of easing function, using Y-coordinates.

The Bézier curve is (0,0) to (1,1), with each control point having a value between 0 and 1...

Near-0 X // Slower, more gradual pacing; typically smooth.
Near-1 X // Quicker changes in pacing; typically jerky.
Near-0 Y // Stiff, abrupt, jerky easing.
Near-1 Y // Springy, bouncy, smooth easing.

c1 = 0.1 "Slow start" => 1 "Fast start";
c2 = 0.1 "Jerky start" => 1 "Smooth start";
c3 = 0.1 "Slow end" => 1 "fast end";
c4 - 0.1 "Jerky end" => 1 "Smooth end";

With the exception of "alternate" and "alternate-reverse", predefined easings can be made with a Bézier curve...

"Linear" // cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1) // Consistent, linear motion.

"Ease" // cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) // Standard easing in and out.

"Ease-in" // cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1, 1) // Starts slow, then speeds up.

"Ease-out" // cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1) // Starts fast, then slows down.

"Ease-in-out" // cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1) // Starts and ends slow, speeds up in the middle.

Basically, cubic-bezier() is a fine-tuning tool for animations; it is added between the duration and easing / timing functions.





## Iteration Values ##

Either "infinite" or a set number. Defaults to 1 cycle.





## Combining Animations ##

----- Outside of defining different types of transformations and transitions, within the same animation, animations can be combined through the "animation:" property.

----- The animations need to be separated with commas.

EXAMPLE:

.myClassRule {
    animation:
        myAnimation1 5s ease infinite,
        myAnimation2 4s alternate 5,
        myAnimation3 1s backwards 10,
}

----- All animations retain their individual keyframe timings and iteration counts, allowing for complex layering. 

----- Using multiple "animation:" properties does not work; the last property will overwrite all the others.

EXAMPLE:

.myClass {
    animation: myAnimation1 5s ease infinite,
    animation: myAnimation2 4s alternate 5,
    animation: myAnimation3 1s backwards 10,
}

----- Only the third animation will apply.

----- There can be compatibility issues with the above, so it's best to just define unique animations with all the necessary transforms, transitions, and property changes.

----- For the "transform:" property, this is done by linking all the rotate, translate, scale, and skew values in a single property.

----- Other properties can be chained in the same frame by using a semicolon divisor.

EXAMPLE:

@keyframes myCombinedAnimation {
    0% { transform: scale(1) rotate(0deg); font-size: 14px; color: black; }
    100% { transform: scale(2) rotate(180deg); font-size: 28px; color: red; }
}






## Transitions ##

----- Transitions are an easy way of defining simple animations. Instead of using @keyframes, you can define the properties to transition in a pseudoclass, and then add the "transition:" property and all its values in the base class...

EXAMPLE:

myText {
    transition: font-size 5s linear;
}

myText:hover {
    font-size: 30px;
}

----- The values of the "transition" property are almost identical to "animation:", but instead of naming an animation, you specify the property to be changed.

----- To chain multiple property changes together, list them within the same "transition:" property, separated by commas...

EXAMPLE:

myText {
    transition: font-size 5s linear infinite, 
    color 2s alternate 5, 
    text-decoration 10s infinite;
}

myText:hover {
    font-size: 30px;
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: underline;
}

----- Pseudoclasses like ":active" and ":hover" behave differently when it comes to the "transition:" property...

":active" // Ignores timings, instantly reverting the transition upon releasing a click or removing a finger. 

":hover" // Attempts to smoothly reverse any transitioned properties upon losing the hover state.

----- Basically, use "transition:" to smoothly change the properties of an element during events such as clicks and hovers. For more complex sequences, "animation:" and keyframes provide much greater control.



## Clip-Path ##

----- The "border-radius:" property is used to effectively "round" the corners of an element to create circular shapes, and can also be configured for angular shapes such as triangles, however there is another property that allows for advanced shapes to be created more easily: "clip-path".

----- "clip-path:" is essentially like using a shape-cutter; you have the clip-path serving as a "mould", which is then applied to the element. Every part of the element within the borders of the clip-path is kept, with everything outside of it hidden.

----- The arguments of these attributes are best used with percentile units, save for "clip-path: path*()", which uses its own SVG path expression.

clip-path: inset(%, %, %, %); // Clips an element to a rectangular shape. Up to 4 values (top, right, left, bottom); similar to "border-radius:".

clip-path: circle(%); // Clips an element to a circular shape. 1 value. 

clip-path: ellipse(h% v% at px% py%); // Clips an element to an elliptical shape. 1 horizontal and 1 vertical value, with optional "at" to determine origin of the clip with X and Y values. 

clip-path: polygon(vx vy, vx vy,...); // Clips an element to a custom polygon shape, based on vertices coordinates. Can accept any number of paired x-y values. Can be used to create highly complex shapes, although using more than 20-ish vertices can cause rendering performance issues. Best used with a generator tool, such as [Bennett Feely's "Clippy"](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/).

//// Advanced Values: Need to explore these more ////

path("svg-expression"); // Clips the element based on a SVG path expression.
url("svg-image-location"); // Clips the element based on the path data stored in an SVG image.
none; // Removes any clipping; useful for animations and changes in state.
